<h1>Try out some new ideas for Britannica Pathways: Science</h1>

<h2>Let us know your honest opinion!</h2>
<p class="text-">
    We, at Britannica, are thinking about new types of resources to add to the Investigate section of Pathways. In addition, we are considering adding drag-and-drop questions to the wrap up in each lesson.  We would like to know what you think about these ideas and the samples below.
</p>

<table class="table table-bordered">
    <thead>
    <tr>
        <th>What might Britannica add to Pathways?</th>
        <th>How would they be used?</th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
    <tr>
        <td>
            <strong>New Investigate Resources</strong> would be more interactive and engaging for the student. In some cases, the new resource would focus on data, graphs, and data interpretation.

        </td>
        <td>
            Students would use these new resources to investigate the lesson topic just as they do with the current resources. While interacting with the new resource, students would take notes to use later in the lesson when they draw their final conclusion.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
            <strong>New Wrap-up Questions</strong> would resemble some of the drag and drop questions found on the PARCC and Smarter Balanced Assessments.
            <img src="img/wrap-up.png" width="479" height="197" />
        </td>
        <td>
            Students would complete the additional wrap-up question at the end of a Pathways lessons.
